Title: Learning new tools and giving back, ARM at Scipy2017
-----------------------------------------------------------

ARM developers, translators and engineers from three laboratories attended
the Scientific Computing with Python (Scipy, [1]) conference in Austin Texas. Scipy i
a unique conference that consists of three parts: Tutorials [2], Conference talks
and posters [3] and, finally, two days of code sprinting [4]. 

The other unique aspect of Scipy is that it is focuses on the tools that are used
across diverse domains. There is a focus on the "how" over the "what". The main
benefit to the ARM program is attendees come away with a quiver of new tools
saving many hours of coding. 

Developers and Engineers from across the ARM program attended tutorials at the beginning of the week. They were led by expert instructors
(often core code developers) on Machine Learning, visualization, code optimization and project
Jupyter (an interactive notebook environment and tool for scientific
reproducibility). 

The Conference proper kicked off Wednesday with Keynote sessions and poster
sessions. Precipitation Radar Translator and Py-ART lead Scott Collis presented
a poster on ARM's radar retrieval efforts. Bobby Jackson and Mark Picel, also
from Argonne, showed some recent results from CMDV funded work on multi-Doppler
vertical velocity retrievals and storm cell tracking. 

On Friday Joseph Hardin, from Pacific Northwest National Lab and ARM Radar
engineer gave a well received talk on WARNO: Watchdog for ARM Radar Network
Operations.

Bhargavi Krishna from Oakridge National Laboratory and Erol Cromwell and Carina
Lansing from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory also attended to learn the
latest tools in the Scipy stack which will help them better deliver data to ARM
Users. 

Saturday and Sunday was set aside for code sprinting where diverse (by funding
and field) scientists get together in large groups and collaboratively work
through issues in popular community software packages. Bobby and Zach sprinted
on the three dimensional visualization package yt [5] where the team was very
interested in using yt to visualize ARM radar data. Mark sprinted on Pandas [6]
which is a high performance data analysis library.

ARM Team members use software every working day. Scipy sprints allow us to give
back to the community tools that make our work possible and learn from very
clever developers along the way!
